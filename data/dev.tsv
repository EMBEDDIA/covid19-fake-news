The  cure  for  the  C19  virus  or  the  way  to  eliminate  it  was  achieved.  Information  comes  from  Israel  there  this  virus  did  not  cause  any  death.  The  recipe  is  simple.  1.  Lemon,  2  Bicarbonate.  Mix  and  drink  as  hot  tea  every  afternoon,  the  action  of  the  lemon  with  hotter  baking  soda  immediately  kills  the  virus  completely  eliminates  it  from  the  body.  These  two  components  alkalize  the  immune  system,  since  when  night  falls  the  system  becomes  acidic  and  defenses  lower.  That  is  why  the  People  of  Israel  is  relaxed  about  this  virus.
